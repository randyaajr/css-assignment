        Welcome to The Striped Umbrella — a full-service resort and spa just steps from the Gulf of Mexico and ten miles east
        of Crab Key, Florida. Come enjoy the best of both worlds, a secluded sandy beach populated with beautiful birds, yet a
        short drive down the road from world-class shopping, restaurants, and entertainment. Bring a good book and leave your
        laptop at the office. You won't want to go home
